			<p>Hi, I am Manan Mongia. I am currently pursuing B.Tech CSE from Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology. My area of interest lies in Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, I have been studying Machine Learning for quite a while now. What drives me is the potential of Machine Learning and what we can achieve using it. All the math aside, it gives me an adrenaline rush when my code simulates a self-driving car or learn to differentiate between Dog and a Cat. I have worked on few projects that like basic approach to Self-Driving Car Program and Stock Prediction Program. I am currently studying and working through Deep Learning online content as well as Reinforcement Learning.
			</p>		
			<p>
				My major part in that project was on backend in Ruby on Rails, so I can dabble in few backend stuff as well in website development. I have also contributed on to my University Fest websites called Rhythm. My major programming language is java and Python, but sometimes I work using C++ to get a feel of handling actual pointers to do something. I would like to work further developing my Coding and Machine Learning skills to improve my work overtime.
				 Another field that fascinates me is Block Chain that feels like a final or upcoming major de-Centralized computation technology. Since major Startup companies have already started working on them, I can actually dirty my hands on coding aspects on Ethereum
				Apart from Programming aspects I have also shown leadership and team spirit qualities in various Events like Workshops, Hackathons etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am also a member of Google Developer’s Group New Delhi that organizes various tech community events like Google I/O Extended and Google DevFest Extended. I am also working on to crack GSOC’19 where I am working with members from across the globe to build projects.</p>
